# polytracker
tracking polymerization processes across a membrane through TIRF experiment data

A data structure like "TracksFinal" should be loaded into the workspace and then passed as an argument into "polytrack", along with the frame spacing (dt), and some "Label" to assign to your data in the resulting plots.

Editting master.m, and running the relevant scripts from there should be sufficient.
